# Repository Workflow: Gitflow

This repository uses Gitflow for branching and release management.

Branches
- main: Production-ready code. Only merge from release/* and hotfix/*.
- develop: Integration branch for the next release. Default branch for day-to-day work.
- feature/*: Topic branches created from develop for new work.
- release/*: Stabilization branches created from develop when preparing a release.
- hotfix/*: Emergency fixes created from main, merged back to main and develop.

Feature Workflow
1. Branch from develop using feature/<short-kebab-summary>.
2. Commit work frequently; prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:, perf:).
3. Open a PR into develop. Request review; ensure CI passes.
4. Squash or rebase-merge per repository settings.

Release Workflow
1. Create release/<version> from develop.
2. Only allow bug fixes, docs, and release metadata (CHANGELOG, version bumps).
3. Merge release/* into main and tag main with v<version>.
4. Merge release/* back into develop to keep it updated.

Hotfix Workflow
1. Create hotfix/<short-kebab-summary> from main.
2. Implement the fix, bump patch version if applicable.
3. Merge hotfix/* into main and tag main with the new version.
4. Merge hotfix/* back into develop.

Pull Request Guidelines
- Title: <type>: <short imperative summary>
- Description: What changed, why, tests/verification.
- Link issues with "Closes #<id>" when applicable.
- Require at least one review and green checks.

Commit Message Guidelines (Conventional Commits)
- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- chore/docs/refactor/test/perf/build/ci: as applicable
- Use present tense, imperative mood. Keep first line <= 72 chars.

Versioning & Tags
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Tag releases on main as v<version> (e.g., v1.2.3).

Naming Conventions
- feature/<kebab-case-topic>
- release/<version>
- hotfix/<kebab-case-topic>

Notes for Cursor
- Default work happens against develop.
- Prefer small, focused PRs from feature/* into develop.
- Keep this file updated if process changes.
